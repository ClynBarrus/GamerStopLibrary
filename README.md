# GamerStopLibrary
Class project where we must build a program that will sort a client's (in this case the teacher) library of video games for his store. 
  Timpview Gamer Stop will have windows computers being accessed by 
employees and customers. Will be written in Java. Computers won’t 
be the greatest, but they will be enough. Program will be class based.
Client needs a way to organize inventory by price of games 
(client’s selling price and what he bought it for), platforms, used games, 
and by where it is in the store. Needs to have Admin (client or employee) 
and Guest access, where guest shows limited data. When Admin access is requested, 
require password. Program will allow user to search for a game and
choose how they want to sort the list, then display all items of the apply 
to the criteria. Admin user can enter new sold or bought games if needed. 
 
We will also need to store items entered into a database for later.
